            <h2>What You Should Know About Building Computers. </h2>
            <div>
                <h3>It really is easy to do.</h3>
                    <p>
                        When colleges students and parents flock to reddit and other forums looking for information on what type of computer to purchase
                        for themselves or for their child, most desktop users will tell them to build their own rather than buying a prebuilt as they will
                        be able to save a good amount of money and purchase better parts, though it is always recommend that if you are not confident or just 
                        do not want to take the chance of breaking or destroying something buying a prebuilt is the way to go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Having said that, a common saying that is told to new pc builder before they start building is that putting together a computer is similar
                        to putting together legos: You guys put the right part in the right place where the manual tell you to place it then plug the power supply into 
                        the computer then turn it on. If everything goes right, static shock doesn't kill your part, and you buy the correct part, you will have a working
                        computer in no time. 
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>It really is hard to do</h3>
                    <p>
                        Well, it sounds easy doesn't it? Just place everything together like legos and everything will work. Well sometimes you 
                        can put everything in the right place with the right parts that match the board and work with the cpu and you can still have problems getting the computer 
                        to turn on <em>OR</em> you can get the computer to turn on but you won't get anything to output to the monitor not matter what you do. It could be that you have the 
                        monitor plugged into the motherboard when you should have it plugged in to the graphics card, that is if you are lucky. A worse situation would be the computer turning 
                        on but not outputting to the monitor and you have the monitor plugged in to the right port. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things can go wrong and not work for no reason at all or it could be a niche reason that you, a beginner pc builder, would not 
                        think would be a problem. 
                    </p>

                <h3><q>I just want a black box</q>- The Everlasting Quest for the Perfect Part</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes finding the right part for what you need is really easy but lately with the silicon shortage, energy crisis, 
                        steel price increase, and other things, finding the right part for the right price is harder than what is used to be especially 
                        after a launch of a new generation of CPUs. That is not taking into consideration the fact that many companies and distributors, lately,
                        have been having problems keeping stock of items. <em>Then</em> there are the scalpers that come when there are items that are in stock and 
                        come to buy large amounts of parts to resell at higher prices. This happens a lot and also happens in the gaming field with the latest example 
                        being the PS5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But lets say that you don't want the newest toy on the block. There should be older parts that you can buy, right? Maybe a older gen platform 
                        that still runs well and isn't really that old for what you are looking for. You should have no problem get the items you need, right? Well, not so.
                        Even if the platform was one generation ago and the company ran that gen only three years ago, distributors could still be having problem with keeping stock, 
                        weather it is too many people purchasing the item or the company that makes them is not making enough of them, there can still be stock problems.             
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all of that said, there is still the problem of personal choice. For example, most the most common type of case that is available on the market will be one 
                        that has a tempered glass window on it and it is rather hard to find a current generation case that is just a simple case with no window. Now you might ask, why would 
                        someone not what a tempered glass window on there case? Well the answer to that is that many of these window tend to crack, if not shatter, at random times and there isn't 
                        really a brand or manufacturer that is worse or better than another, all of them do it at one point or another.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plus many people just prefer the simple, clean look. Due to this, many 
                        have to look for older cases that have the solid side panels that they want but the cases that are solid and also have good features like good air circulation or good hard drive support 
                        may not be in stock in a lot of online or ever brick-in-mortar stores. That or they have increase in price due to the manufacturer lower production of that particular case and thus lowering
                        online distributors stock of it. Another thing that could cause it to be hard to find the right case would be popularity. With the advent of so many tempered glass case failure, solid panel 
                        cases have gained a bit of popularity and that could also cause a increase of price and lowering of stock. <em>Sigh</em> This is just for a case, imagine for the rest of a computer!

                <p>
                    This is the first step that you should taking when beginning the path of building your computer. Though you could 
                    switch this with step 2 as number 1 but I think it is better to know how much you are willing to spend based on the 
                    money you have available or have saved up rather then picking the platform first. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In today's economy, based on what you need/want, you can get away with a 450 dollars and this is for a entry level gaming computer build on the AMD platform.
                    I chose the AMD platform because, honestly, AMD has really picked up the pace with their Ryzen line and they have been known for the lower prices, at least compared 
                    to Intel, for a while. They still give a good price-to-performance ratio or you can go as high as you want but I wouldn't go beyond 2500 dollars but I've seen some 
                    insanely high priced computers. It's all what you want to do.

                        because one they get their budget then they will be able to make more reasonable, cost-effective decisions rather than
                        choosing with their eyes because they see all of the shiny toys and start picking with their eyes.

                    <p>
                        So in the step, what I would suggest would be to go to youtube and look for these youtubers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK51upU5bkU" target="_blank"> JayzTwoCents</a>
                        , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7MYOpFONCU" target="_blank">Linus Tech Tips</a> have good videos on how to building computers and the links I gave will send you to some tutorials.
                        When looking for information about building computers, it is really important to make sure that the people that you are watching actually know what they are talking about. There was 
                        a famous video made by a channel that gave all sorts of incorrect information from using a screwdriver from one of those pocket multi-tools to tightening the motherboard down. It was bad.
                        If you don't know who to watch or listen to for information on building or working with computer, go to another website-Reddit.com. There you will find a subreddit called r/buildapc where you 
                        can ask simple and complex questions. They even have a discord you can join to get help.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After you look up how to build a pc, go to the same people that you look at before or look up a youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus" target="_blank">Gamers Nexus</a>, an amazing channel with a very longstanding reputation for giving 
                        in-depth reviews of computer components and comparing them to others in the same category, in order to find what platform you want. On Gamers Nexus, they even tell you what applications work well on what Cpus the best and which 
                        which cpu is the best bang for the budget.
                    </p>

                <h3 id="cpu">Research and Purchase the CPU you need for specification or want</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is pretty much common sense but you would be surprized by how many people skip through this part and end up getting 
                        the wrong Cpu and motherboard due to lack of attention or just not researching enough. This, again, 
                        will be based on what you will be using your computer for. If you are doing things that require a lot of multi-tasking,
                        then you will want a cpu with more cores. If you playing games or are using programs that like really good single-core performance, then
                        get a cpu with a higher clock speed, that is also within your budget, will be the best choice for you. Though honestly, the conversation is rather 
                        nuanced. You best bet will be to just pick a the the best you can get within your budget. If all you can afford at the moment is the 
                        lower end cpus at the moment but you really need a computer, then either save more money for a better cpu and a lower 
                        end motherboard or build a lower end computer and save up again to build a better computer in three years.

                    <p>
                        This one is rather simple. As it says, you should look at videos from the youtube channels that I listed above, Gamers Nexus is the best for product review, 
                        and decide what you want based on your needs and budget. For example, I when I was building my computer for school, I was also building for the purpose of gaming as well as being 
                        able to do other aspects of web development including backend as well as photoshop. For that, I need to look as what type of resolution I wanted to game at since this was the factor in which 
                        the gpu would be worked hard as well as in photoshop. So, in my case, since I really want to game in 1080p and I feel that, at my level, 1080p is enough resolution to have as well as 
                        the fact that the monitors that I already own operate at 1080 @ 60hz so in all honestly, I don't really need a high tier gpu. I can get a cheaper one and will be able to spend more money 
                        on other parts or I can get a better one so that it will last longer so that if I want to upgrade, I just need to upgrade my cpu and motherboard and nothing else.

                <h3 id="memory">Research and Purchase The Memory That You Need For Your CPU</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most overlooked parts of the computer is the RAM. The wrong RAM can impact your computers performance in gaming or in other things. For example, if you are doing things like word processing, you will see 
                        a decease in performance in you computer and if you do not have enough RAM in general, you will see an general sluggishness in your computer. There are many releases of new memory with different speeds, ranks, timings,
                        and capacities. So many that sifting through the never-ending list of models is amazingly time-consuming. To find the right RAM for your computer, I will point you to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ram-benchmark-hierarchy">this article</a>
                        to start you off with research. 
                    </p>     
                    <p> Personal for AMD and Intel, I usually go for 4800 minimum speed RAM just do to the fact that I have not had problem at this speed as of yet, having said that I do not do a lot of really intensive things on my computer save for gaming 
                        and with gaming 4800 has worked just fine. That said, faster, if you can afford it, is usually better.

                <h3 id="powersupply"> Research and Purchase The Power Supply That You May Need</h3>
                    <p>
                    When it comes to figuring out which power supply to get, you should first figure out how much power you need for you computer. Many power supply sellers have calculators on their websites that you can use to give you a rough estimate and 
                    pcpartpicker is a website that you can use to build a computer list and it will list an approximate wattage that all of the parts will be. You also need to take in to consideration, when choosing you psu, gpu power consumption. For example: 12+4 pin 
                    connectors on the upcoming and some current generation graphics cards will use will provide up to 600w of power. At the moment, a pair of 6+2 pin connector on dedicated cables are rate for 300w and three of these connector can deliver up to 450w safely.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main issue that power supplies are said to have isn't the maximum sustained power consumption of a GPU but the power spikes that can happen. That is why many manufacturers suggest strong PSU 
                        for high-tiered graphics cards. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to consider will be the physical dimensions of your case before you purchase it. This goes hand-in-hand with all of the parts of your computer but especially your GPU. The reason being is that there are different sizes of power supplies like ATX and 
                        SFX power supplies. If you get a standard ATX case, whether or not is it high-tier or not, at ATX power supply will fit but keep in mind many higher-wattage PSU are longer th an the typical 5.5 inches so be sure to look at the the measurements of the PSU area. If you 
                        have a really small or slim PC case, you will want to get a more compact SFX power supply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last thing to consider: A modular power supply. If you decided to get a case that has a lot of room behind the motherboard, or your case doesn't have 
                        window or glass side, you can tie the wire you don't need and stash them inside your rig but if the system you're building doesn't have space then it's worth
                        investing in a modular power supply. Modular PSUs allow you to only plug in the power cables you need and leave the rest in the box.

                        This part will include both steps 7 and 8 together for the sake of time.

                    <h4>Pc Cases/Chassis</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cases, or Chassis, can come in different shapes and sizes with some even holding more than one motherboard, allowing for a two computer build to be in one case. When you start to look around for one, you need to look out for the following terms as they are used to 
                            identify not only the type of case but also the type of motherboard the case is designed to accommodate as well as implying that for the cases size might hold a bigger motherboard and vice versa:
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Mini-ITX: Supports Motherboards measuring 6.75 x 6.75 inches</li>
                                <li>MicroATX: Supports motherboards measuring a maximum of 9.63 x 9.63 inches</li>
                                <li>ATX: Supports Motherboards measuring 12 x 9.63 inches(LxW)</li>
                                <li>XL/EATX: Supports Motherboards measuring 12 x 13 inches(LxW)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>
                            Make sure to take note that most cases can support smaller motherboards type. An example would be
                            the fact that many ATX cases can support Mini-ITX or MicroATX motherboards.There are also some other terms that you might see used to describe cases when you 
                            shopping for one:
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Desktop</b> - Horizontal Design. Sometimes monitors sit on top of a desktop case/chassis</li>
                                <li><b>SFF</b> - Stands for Small Form Factor. These are compact chassis for accommodating mini-ATX or smaller proprietary motherboards</li>
                                <li><b>Mini-Tower</b> - Standard Vertical Tower. No specific size but smaller than mid-tower and full tower</li>
                                <li><b>Mid-Tower</b> - Standard Vertical Tower. No specific size but bigger than mini-tower and smaller than full tower</li>
                                <li><b>Full Tower</b> - Usually 18 inches tall or more</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>
                            Different cases have different features from one another. Some have only 2.5 inch drive bay for SSDs. Others have only 3.5 inch bays for hard drives 
                            and there are some other cases that have, in addition to 2.5 or 3.5 drive bays, a 5.25 drive bay for optical drives. Then there are cases that have a mixture of both or all three.
                            There are also cases that have different input/output shields for different port and various case fan or water-cooling support capabilities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For my last two build, I went with Fractal Design for my cases due to drive bay support, silence, and the fact that I could get 
                            cases with solid side panels rather than one with tempered glass.
                        </p>
                    
                    <h4>Case Fans</h4>
                        <p>
                            PC or case fans are the first defense against heat protection when it comes to thermal regulation in your computer. Some of the best PC fans can keep even 
                            the most intense gaming rig cool. Most of the time, however they are rather overlooked by builders. Cool hardware is <em>the</em> most important thing when it 
                            comes to the longevity of your computer and fans are so important for that, that many times computer repairers will first check to see if the fans are working properly 
                            if there are temperature problems with a computer. Plus, it's not just keeping the parts cools, it's also maintaining and ensuring good airflow as well. Noctua are some of the 
                            best case/pc fans on the market and there are also some Corsair fans that are also very good. Again, I would point you to looking for articles or to visit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/" target="_blank">Build A Pc subreddit</a>
                            for advice.

                    <h4>Keyboard and Mice</h4>
                        <p>
                            Lets start with Mice. For mice, this sortof depends on what exactly you mainly doing. If it is for gaming, then you will want a mouse with a high DPI or Dots Per Inch, 
                            however if you are working from home with some gaming on the side, you might want to get a ergonomic mouse instead. There is also the choice between wired mice and wireless. 
                            The choices are endless really, so I will list down some that I have used for both work and play.
                        </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Razer Naga Pro - The best MMO Mouse</li>
                                <li>Logitech G203 Lightsync - The Best Cheap Gaming Mouse</li>
                                <li>Logitech MX Vertical - The Best Ergonomic Productivity Mouse</li>
                                <li>Razer Orochi V2 - Best Multipurpose Mouse</li>
                                <li>Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro - Just A Good Mouse </li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>With your mouse, you need a keyboard and for keyboards there are two types: Membrane and Mechanical.</p>
                            <h5>Membrane</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Membrane Keyboards are ones that use a rubber or silicone membrane beneath the keys to register keystrokes. These types of keyboards
                                    are the most common type of keyboards on the market today. Within each key of a membrane keyboard, there is a small rubber or silicone 
                                    beneath it. When a key is pressed, the dome falls which presses a circuit underneath it and registers the keystrokes. There are many advantages 
                                    to these types of keyboards with them being less expensive than other types of keyboards being one of them. They are also lightweight, thin, and quiet, making 
                                    them a good choice to use in public or shared spaces. A negative, however, is that they are not as durable or as reliable as other types of keyboards.
                                </p>
                            <h5>Mechanical</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Mechanical keyboards are a keyboard type that use mechanical switches beneath each key to register each keystroke. These switches are more durable 
                                    ane more reliable than the rubber or silicone domes used in membrane keyboards. In addition, they provide a more tactile and audible feedback to the users.
                                    Mechanical switches use different mechanisms to register keystrokes, but they all share a few key characteristics. Each switch has a metal spring and a stem 
                                    that press against a metal contact, completing an electrical circuit and registering the keystroke. The spring gives a tactile feedback and the coveted <q>click</q>
                                    that many lovers of mechanical keyboards love.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One advantage that this type of keyboard has over membrane is going to be durability. The switches that are used in the keyboards are rated for tens of millions of keystrokes, 
                                    making them a good choice for those who type a lot or who want a keyboard that will last a long time. Another positive is that they are customizable, with the ability on some 
                                    of the keyboards to hot-swap the switches out with different ones. One negative, however, is that they tend to be on the expensive side of things with the cheaper ones being around 
                                    159. Add on to that the fact that they need much more maintenance than membrane, with the switches becoming dirty or worn with time and needing to be cleaned or replaced.
