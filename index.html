            <h2>The Start of It All</h2>
            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in Waco, Texas in the early 1990's to a woman that lived in a town with the population of one of the middle schools in the city
                that I live in now. McGregor was my mother's birthplace and home and she left it not long after her own mother passed away. After having me, she moved
                to a place called Moody. It was another small, poor place that seemed to be left and trapped in time. Despite it being the 1990's, it was segregated between 
                black people and white people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few years of living in Moody, my mother moved me and my older brother to Temple, Texas, a larger city compared to what I was used to, and while things
                were financially bad for us in our small country town, in the city, things were so much more worse. We lived a harsh life with very little help from family. So
                entertainment usually came from either the Tv or from playing outdoors with the other neighborhood kids. Time moves forward and technology advances. I had heard of computer
                before but getting one was never a thought that ever crossed my mind, it was just too much money to spend. Due to that lack of money that we had, the only internet access I had was
                with my school with computer lessons and the public library when I got my first taste of computer games and from it gained my love of computers.
